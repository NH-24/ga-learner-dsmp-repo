### Project Overview

 Using the method of Boosting, classify whether or not the customer will churn.




### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, I have a better understanding of how to build a boosting model. In this project, I  apply the following concepts.
- Handling missing values in data
- Applying AdaBoost
- Applying XGBoost
- Interpreting evaluation metrics
- Accepting 'y_test' did insert the following text: y_test


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Firstly,I Load the data then cleaning of the data.After that apply the AdaBoost Implementation as per instrustions and obervesation.then applied XGBoost Implemations as per instructions.calculated Accuray Score,Confustion  Matrix,Clasiffication Report of Telecom Churn Prediction and Boosting.


### Challenges faced

 Using varoius parameters for diiferent classiffers like DecisionTree , AdaBoost ,RandamForest,GridSearch etc
and parameters for GradientBoosting ,XGBoosting.


### Additional pointers

 Another Practice Project should be included for better performance in future.
