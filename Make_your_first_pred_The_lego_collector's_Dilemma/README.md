### Project Overview

  This dataset contains information on lego sets scraped from lego.com. Each observation is a different lego set with various features like how many pieces in the set, rating for the set, number of reviews per set etc. Your aim is to build a linear regression model to predict the price of a set.




### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project,I have the better understanding of how to build a linear regression model. In this project, I apply the following concepts.

Train-test split
Correlation between the features
Linear Regression
MSE andR^2 Evaluation Matrics


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 1.Data loading and splitting
The first step - you know the drill by now - load the dataset and see how it looks like. Additionally, split it into the train and test set.
2.Predictor Check!
This tells us which features are highly correlated with the target variable list_price and help us predict it better
3.Reduce feature redundancies!
Features highly correlated with each other adversely affect our lego pricing model. 
4.Apply MSE andR^2 Evaluation Matrics


### Challenges faced

 using linear regression algorithm .Apply MSE andR^2 Evaluation Matrics
